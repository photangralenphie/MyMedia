# MyMedia
MyMedia is a simple app written purely in SwiftUI for displaying your local movie and TV show library.
It is supposed to be an alternative to Apples TV app, as it lacks a lot of functionality for local media.

## Library 
You can import Media files into MyMedia. All data is read from the included metadata of the file.
I recommend [Subler](https://github.com/SublerApp/Subler) for metadata editing.

It is currently not supported and planned to edit metadata directly in MyMedia.

## Features
 - Display your media library gorgeously with Artworks and details about the movie or show.
 - Play with the included player or with the system default app.
 - Tracking of unwatched movies and TV shows and episodes.
 - Create collections of your shows and movies.
 - Pinning and favoriting of media.
 - Separate genres for TV shows and Movies.
 - Languages
    - English
    - German

## Roadmap
These features are currently planned (not in a particular order):
 - ~~Collections: Group several movies or TV Shows together~~ (DONE).
 - Library Search: Searching the complete library including all metadata.
 - Recent Tab: A view to show recently added Movies, TV Shows and episodes.
 - Episode Detail: A nice detail page for a single episode of a TV show.
 - List and List-Detail Views.
 - Support for more file types.
 - update Metadata after changes made to the original file.
 - better support for vertical artwork
